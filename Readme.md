Our platform integrates learning resources, skill verification, and career opportunities into a unified ecosystem, helping students navigate their educational journey with clarity and purpose.

## 📚 Problem Statement

Universities and students often face several challenges in the academic ecosystem:

1. **Disconnected Learning Experience**: Students struggle to find structured learning paths aligned with industry requirements. Academic curricula sometimes lag behind rapidly evolving industry needs, creating a skills gap.

2. **Skill Verification Gap**: Lack of standardized certification systems to validate student skills for employers. Traditional degrees don't always showcase specific technical competencies that employers are looking for.

3. **Limited Networking Opportunities**: Students have difficulty connecting with peers, mentors, and potential employers, especially in remote or hybrid learning environments.

4. **Absence of Practical Coding Environments**: Limited access to integrated coding platforms for practice and assessment. Many students lack real-world programming experience despite theoretical knowledge.

5. **Roadmap Confusion**: Students face uncertainty about what to learn and in which order, especially in fast-evolving fields like technology where the learning path isn't always clear.

6. **Portfolio Development Challenges**: Students struggle to showcase their skills and projects in a professional manner that resonates with potential employers.

7. **Fragmented Resources**: Learning materials, practice platforms, and job opportunities exist in separate ecosystems, making the educational journey disjointed.

University Connect is a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the gap between academic education and industry requirements. Our platform integrates learning resources, skill verification, and career opportunities into a unified ecosystem, helping students navigate their educational journey with clarity and purpose.

  

## 📚 Problem Statement

  

Universities and students often face several challenges in the academic ecosystem:

  

1. **Disconnected Learning Experience**: Students struggle to find structured learning paths aligned with industry requirements. Academic curricula sometimes lag behind rapidly evolving industry needs, creating a skills gap.

  

2. **Skill Verification Gap**: Lack of standardized certification systems to validate student skills for employers. Traditional degrees don't always showcase specific technical competencies that employers are looking for.

  

3. **Limited Networking Opportunities**: Students have difficulty connecting with peers, mentors, and potential employers, especially in remote or hybrid learning environments.

  

4. **Absence of Practical Coding Environments**: Limited access to integrated coding platforms for practice and assessment. Many students lack real-world programming experience despite theoretical knowledge.

  

5. **Roadmap Confusion**: Students face uncertainty about what to learn and in which order, especially in fast-evolving fields like technology where the learning path isn't always clear.

  

6. **Portfolio Development Challenges**: Students struggle to showcase their skills and projects in a professional manner that resonates with potential employers.

  

7. **Fragmented Resources**: Learning materials, practice platforms, and job opportunities exist in separate ecosystems, making the educational journey disjointed.

## 🔒 Security Measures

  

University Connect implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and provide a secure environment for all platform activities:

  

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

  

- **JWT-based Authentication System**:

  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication

  - Access tokens with limited lifespan (15 minutes)

  - Refresh token rotation for persistent sessions

  - Secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage

  

- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:

  - Granular permission system with user roles (Student, Instructor, Admin, Employer)

  - Resource-level access controls

  - Action-based permissions (read, write, delete)

  

- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:

  - Optional two-factor authentication via email or authenticator apps

  - Required MFA for administrative actions

  - Device fingerprinting for suspicious login detection

  

### 2. Data Protection

  

- **Encryption**:

  - Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds

  - Data-at-rest encryption for sensitive information

  - TLS/SSL for all data in transit (HTTPS)

  

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**:

  - Server-side validation of all user inputs

  - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

  - HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

  - JSON schema validation for API requests

  

- **Data Minimization & Privacy**:

  - Collection of only necessary personal information

  - Configurable privacy settings for user profiles

  - Data retention policies with automatic purging

  - GDPR and CCPA compliance mechanisms

  

### 3. API Security
